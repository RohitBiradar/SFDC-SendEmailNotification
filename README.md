Dynamic email notification through email template and custom label

Created a Email template as text and created custom label and value of label is the name of email template.

This would make your email notification system dynamic. You need to just mention name of your new template or just edit the tempalate as you want. Thats it. You do not need to make any changes in the existing code.

Just is the alpha version.
